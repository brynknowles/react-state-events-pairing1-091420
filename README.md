# React State and Events - Async

<!-- ## Instructions

- To get started you must have `JSON Server` installed

  - `npm install json-server`

- To mount the server run the following command in this project's root directory:

  - `json-server -w db.json`

- After mounting the server, you will have an api available at `http://localhost:8000/dogs` -->

## Deliverables

You are given a component called `DogCard`, a container component called `DogsList`, an `App` component

<!-- 1. Your application render a list of dog images along with a button for each image that has an `innerText` of "Bark" -->
<!-- 
2. When a User clicks on the "Bark" button it should render an `<h2>` to the screen with an innerText of "Bark" -->

<!-- 3. When a User clicks on the button a second time the `<h2>` should be removed from the DOM -->

4. Add a `BarkCounter` that is a child of `App` and is displayed at the top of the DOM. This should be a counter that increments every time a dog barks

5. A User should be able to add a new dog. This should persist after page refresh
